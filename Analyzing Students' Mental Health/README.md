A Data Analysis Project on International Students' Mental Health.

Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? One Japanese international university decided to find out!

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

Explored student data using PostgreSQL, stored the data using Pandas DataFrame in Jupyter Notebook  and discovered a trend among international students : 
Those with longer durations of stay tend to demonstrate higher average depression test scores and lower scores in social connectedness. Interestingly, they also experience lower levels of acculturative stress compared to students with shorter stays. This observation suggests that students who have not been away from home for an extended period may encounter culture shock and feelings of homesickness.
