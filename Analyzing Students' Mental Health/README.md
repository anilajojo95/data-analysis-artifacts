A Data Analysis Project on International Students' Mental Health.

Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? One Japanese international university decided to find out!
The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

Explored student data using PostgreSQL, then analysed and visualised the data using Pandas DataFrame, Seaborn, Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook. A notable trend emerged among international students:
Those with longer durations of stay tended to exhibit higher average depression test scores and lower scores in social connectedness. Interestingly, they also reported lower levels of acculturative stress compared to students with shorter stays. This observation suggests that students who have not spent a significant amount of time away from their home environment may experience culture shock and feelings of homesickness when they are in a new or unfamiliar setting.
 In other words, individuals who are less accustomed to being away from their home may find it more challenging to adapt to a different culture or environment. This could result in feelings of discomfort, disorientation, or longing for their familiar surroundings, known as homesickness. Therefore, the trend observed in the data, where students with shorter durations of stay exhibit higher levels of acculturative stress, supports the idea that lack of previous exposure to prolonged periods away from home may contribute to these feelings.
